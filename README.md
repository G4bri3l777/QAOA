# Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for Graph 3-Coloring Problem

## Overview

This project implements the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to address the Graph 3-Coloring Problem. The solution leverages quantum computing techniques to provide an efficient approach to this combinatorial problem.

## Libraries Used

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`: Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- `networkx`: A library used for the creation, manipulation, and study of complex networks of nodes and edges.
- `qiskit` (version 1.1): An open-source quantum computing framework for working with quantum circuits and algorithms.
- `qiskit_ibm_runtime`: Provides tools for interfacing with IBM Quantum's cloud-based quantum computing services.
- `scipy.optimize`: A module from SciPy used for optimization tasks, including the `minimize` function used in this project.
- `matplotlib`: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- `itertools`: A library providing functions to work with iterators, used here for generating combinations.

## Setup

To get started with this project, you need to have the following Python libraries installed. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy networkx qiskit==1.1 qiskit_ibm_runtime scipy matplotlib
